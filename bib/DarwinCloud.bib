	abstract = {Since its ratification as a TDWG standard in 2009, data publishers have had to struggle with the essential step of mapping fields in working databases to the terms in Darwin Core Wieczorek et al. 2012 in order to publish and share data using that standard. Doing so requires a good understanding of both the data set and Darwin Core. The accumulated knowledge about these mappings constitutes what we call the "Darwin Cloud." We will explore the nature of data mapping challenges and the potential for semi-automated solutions to them. Specifically, we will look at the "Darwinizer" actor and its usage in related workflows within the Kurator data quality framework and the implications for community-managed vocabularies.},
